# Tic-Tac-Toe
Unit 1 Project: Game Application for Tic-Tac-Toe 

This project is centered on building a two player Tic-Tac-Toe game. The goal is to be able to create 3x3 grid and be able to submit the names of any two players once you hit the play button and be able to retart games with the same two players previously submitted. The game should also keep track of games won by either player. A popup with instructions on how to play the game was also added. 

Forthcoming Features: A mini animation of confetti raining down across the screen when a player wins a game.
